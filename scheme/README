This directory contains implementations of a Scheme-like language in a variety
of programming languages. I'm using this to refresh and expand my knowledge of
these languages and to learn some new concepts, such as hand-writing a parser.

The variation of Scheme implemented isn't close to any real version of Scheme;
for example, the semantics used here for macros are my own invention. In some
languages, I have only implemented a subset of even this limited version of
Scheme.
